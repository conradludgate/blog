# Who am I?

I am Conrad Ludgate,
full time software engineer,
I studied mathematics at uni and sometimes I like to write (badly) about stuff.

# What do I do?

I am a back-end engineer in my professional life but at home I like to do a little bit of everything.
I like to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/).

# What do I write about?

As with a lot of blogs, I write about stuff that I'm interested in.
Usually it's about something I've been working on or with recently.
Other times I just feel like rambling about something.
