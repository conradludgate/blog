# Who am I?

I am Conrad Ludgate, full time software engineer and sometimes I like to write about stuff.

# What do I do?

I am a back-end engineer in my professional life but at home I like to do a little bit of everything.
I like to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/).
